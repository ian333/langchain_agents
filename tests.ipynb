When\\nyour senior parent longs to reminisce about life experiences, favorite personal stories or grandchildren, an in-home\\ncompanion caregiver can be there as a friendly and attentive listener. Companions may help with certain household\\nchores, but their primary purpose is to spend time with the patient.\\n\\xa0\\nLight Housekeeping\\n\\xa0\\nBecause it’s not easy to stay ahead of clutter or clean a home’s nooks and crannies if you’re a senior or disabled, Love\\nand Care HomeCare’s light housekeeping services can literally be a lifesaver. We make it possible for your aging parent\\nor disabled family member to enjoy the peace of mind that comes with a clean and uncluttered home while leaving all\\nthe dirty work to us.\\n\\xa0\\nMemory Care\\nWe provide individuals with Alzheimer’s and cognitive impairment all of the necessary services for a functional daily\\nliving. Developing a routine that provides consistency and ease of function improves the quality of life. Caring for\\npeople suffering from such impairments requires time and patience from family and other care providers. In many\\ncases, people with Alzheimer’s cannot be left alone, requiring constant supervision that can be difficult to provide long-\\nterm.\\n\\xa0\\nAlzheimer’s is the most common form of dementia and gradually becomes more severe over time. Therefore, the needs\\nof people changes throughout the process, requiring caregivers to be conscious of how to best care for them at any\\ngiven time.\\n\\xa0\\nIn the early stages, people with this disease are still able to function independently. However, their ability to handle\\nmany ordinary tasks begins to decrease, requiring even more assistance. This can be difficult for family members and\\nfor those affected who may become frustrated over time.\\nProviding additional care can help ease the burden of family and friends and help take on many time-intensive activities\\nthat are necessary in the care of people with Dementia. This can range from a few hours of help to a full-time role for\\ncaregivers.\\n\\xa0\\nOvernight Care\\nIf staying alone overnight is a concern for your loved one, our experienced overnight companions can provide you with\\nthe assurance your loved one needs to sleep peacefully throughout the night.\\nOur levels of overnight care for elderly are based on the needs of each client. These include bedside sitting suitable for\\nclients in long-term care facilities, or in-home overnight assistance.\\n\\xa0\\nAlongside ensuring that your loved one has a good night's rest, our overnight companion care services include:\\n· \\xa0 Preparing evening snacks\\n· \\xa0 Assisting in getting ready for bed\\n· \\xa0 Transfer assistance throughout the night\\n· \\xa0 Ensuring that your loved one has everything they need for the night (i.e. commode placement, glass of water, night\\nlight, etc.)\\n· \\xa0 Morning care (personal and home care)\\n· \\xa0 Preparing breakfast\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nParkinson’s Home Support Care\\n\\xa0\\nParkinson’s disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative conditions along with Alzheimer’s. Its effects\\nprogress over time and symptoms become more severe which can prove to be difficult for people as they try to cope\\nwith the increased difficulties in their overall function.\\n1-805-716-6654\\nAbout Us Services Testimonials Our People Social Programs Contact Us\\n se of comfort, independence and family belonging6/3/24, 6:35 PM In Home Services | Love And Care\\nhttps://www.loveandcare.life/in-home-services 2/4\", metadata={'source': '/tmp/tmp0wylzt61/In Home Services _ Love And Care.pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content='As the disease progresses, treatment and care for Parkinson’s become an even greater challenge. Patients require\\nmore motivation and emotional care to help maintain a level of independence.\\nProviding care in the home can go a long way in reducing the severity of symptoms by providing a familiar environment\\nthat gives them the reassurance they might need. A system of care that provides comfort, independence, and a level of\\ncompassion that will help them move forward in their journey.\\n\\xa0\\nMedication Reminders\\nAlthough Love and Care caregivers cannot administer medications, they can help ensure that clients take their own\\nmedication as prescribed. Love and care can assist with opening medication containers, reading labels and reminding\\nthe client when it is time to take a dose.\\n\\xa0\\nStroke Recovery Care\\nStrokes occur when the brain suddenly is robbed of blood flow and oxyge n. This can be the result of a blocked blood\\nvessel leading to the brain. The damage that results can last a long period of time and many people require extensive\\nrehabilitation in order to fully recover.\\nAssistance with activities of daily living which include: personal hygiene, meal preparation, dressing, and undressing.\\nAdvanced understanding of various forms of care in order to assist in recovery. Each individual is unique, and our staff\\ncan help carry out daily personal care, feeding, and a variety of necessary services for healthy function.\\nEnd of Life\\nWhen a family member is diagnosed with limited life expectancy, he or she often has a strong desire to spend the final\\ndays in the comfort of home. However, caring for a loved one at the end of life can be emotionally challenging and\\nphysically exhausting.\\nLove and Care caregivers can support you and your loved one by working with a hospice agency or medical provider\\nto fully meet the family’s care needs. We will help care for your loved one and help around the house as well as provide\\nthe family with emotional and moral support.\\nOur ultimate goal is to help families make the most of their time together, helping to lighten the burden at a very difficult\\ntime.\\n\\xa0\\nMeal Planning\\nLove and Care caregivers prepare hot, delicious, and nutritious meals, allowing clients to help with preparation\\naccording to their ability. Many seniors do not have the opportunity to eat a well-balanced meal, so this service helps\\nseniors get the nutrition they need to enjoy healthier living.\\n\\xa0\\nTransportation\\n\\xa0\\nFor your aging parent, driving to an appointment can leave them feeling confused, frightened or unable to negotiate the\\nhigh volume of traffic entering and exiting parking lots. Aging parents who are no longer confident in their driving skills\\nmay not know how to arrange for transportation and may miss important doctor’s appointments versus placing a burden\\non their children by asking for a ride. It’s reassuring to know Love and Care provides senior home care transportation\\nassistance.
